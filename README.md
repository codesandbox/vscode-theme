## Install

Install this syntax theme [from the Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeSandbox-io.codesandbox-theme).

## Recommendations

Bring your Visual Studio Code even closer to the look and feel of CodeSandbox with these suggestions for your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.fontSize": 14,
  "editor.fontFamily": "'Fira Code'",
  "editor.fontLigatures": true
}
```

You can find the [Fira Code font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) on GitHub.
